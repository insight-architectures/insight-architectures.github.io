title: Our pillars
---

At Insight Architectures, we love facilitating our customers' growth by satisfying their needs for software solutions that help their business.

Because we are tasked with designing and developing parts critical to the business of our customers, we have defined a list of pillars that helps us delivering a product we can be proud of.

## Architecture design

Software development has reached a state where everybody can solve today's problems. On the other hand, a properly designed software architecture can add value not only solving today's problems. Instead, it can sustain the growth of a business by facilitating the addition of new features and the support for future use cases.

By carefully studying the problem at hand, we at Insight Architectures focus on understanding the core use cases and spotting the volatilities of the system.

The core use cases and the volatilities help us design a system that is able to react to changes with agility so that the system will stay aligned to the customer's business.

## Project design

Even the best architecture needs a carefully designed plan to be built. This is even more important when coordinating a team.

By carefully studying the several options available to build the system, project design helps our customers taking informed decisions regarding factors like resource allocation and project duration that inevitably affect the execution of the project. Project design helps uncovering and properly handling the compromises between all these factors. With our help and counsel, the customer will be able to choose the project plan that best fits their needs in terms of costs and duration.

Obviously, like everything in software development, a project design isn't set in stone. Delays, redistribution of resources, changed priorities and added features are all but some of the causes that help a project plan evolve over its execution.

Since these changes are continuously tracked, managed and communicated back to the customer, a properly designed and maintained project plan can help keeping track of the advancement of the development and provide accurate estimates on project completion right from the beginning.
